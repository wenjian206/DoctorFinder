# DoctorFinder

## Project Description

DoctorFinder is an app where you can sign in as a Patient to book an appointment, check your bills, update your profile, and search doctors by name or specialty. You can also sign in as a Doctor and view all patients assigned to you, view all pending appointments as well as reject any that you do not want to accept, create bills for patients, and update your profile.
